            Execute the CI random code improvement workflow.

            IMPORTANT: You are running in CI mode without user interaction.
            - Do NOT ask for user confirmation
            - Do NOT perform git commit/push operations (the action handles this)
            - Apply ALL improvements with >90% confidence automatically
            - If no improvements are found after 3 attempts, output exactly: NO_IMPROVEMENTS_FOUND

            Follow the steps in .claude/commands/ci-random-code-improvement.md

            ## Automated Code Improvement

            This PR was created by the weekly random code improvement workflow.

            Claude reviewed random files from the codebase and applied improvements

            - Readability & structure
            - React patterns
            - TypeScript types
            - Accessibility
            - UX (error/loading states)
            - Performance
            - Styling (Tailwind)
