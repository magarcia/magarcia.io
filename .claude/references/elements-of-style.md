## Elementary Rules of Usage

### Rule 1: Possessives

### Rule 2: Oxford Comma

In series of three or more, use comma after each term except last: "red, white,

### Rule 4: Comma Before Conjunction

Place comma before conjunction introducing co-ordinate clause: "The situation is
perilous, but there is still one chance of escape."

romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures."

## Elementary Principles of Composition

### Rule 8: One Paragraph Per Topic

Make the paragraph the unit of composition. Each paragraph signals a new step in
development.

### Rule 9: Topic Sentences

Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end in conformity with the
beginning.

Structure:

1. Topic sentence at or near beginning
2. Succeeding sentences explain, establish, or develop
3. Final sentence emphasizes the thought or states consequence

Avoid ending with digression or unimportant detail.

### Rule 10: Active Voice

The active voice is more direct and vigorous.

| Passive                                        | Active                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| My first visit will always be remembered by me | I shall always remember my first visit |
| A survey of this region was made               | This region was surveyed               |
| There were dead leaves lying on the ground     | Dead leaves covered the ground         |
| The sound of a guitar could be heard           | Somewhere a guitar hummed sleepily     |

### Rule 11: Positive Form

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, non-committal language.

| Negative                      | Positive             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| He was not very often on time | He usually came late |
| did not remember              | forgot               |
| did not pay attention to      | ignored              |
| did not have confidence in    | distrusted           |
| not honest                    | dishonest            |
| not important                 | trifling             |

### Rule 12: Specific and Concrete

Prefer specific to general, definite to vague, concrete to abstract.

| Vague                                                      | Specific                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| A period of unfavorable weather set in                     | It rained every day for a week     |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his reward | He grinned as he pocketed the coin |

### Rule 13: Omit Needless Words

Vigorous writing is concise. Make every word tell.

| Wordy                              | Concise       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| the question as to whether         | whether       |
| there is no doubt but that         | doubtless     |
| used for fuel purposes             | used for fuel |
| he is a man who                    | he            |
| in a hasty manner                  | hastily       |
| this is a subject which            | this subject  |
| owing to the fact that             | because       |
| in spite of the fact that          | although      |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure   |

Combine related ideas:

**51 words:** "Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king
of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish would come true..."

**26 words:** "Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and
realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of
Scotland in his place."

### Rule 14: Vary Sentence Structure

Avoid succession of loose sentences (two clauses joined by and, but, so, which,
when, where, while).

**Monotonous:** "The concert was given last evening, and a large audience was in
attendance. Mr. Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra
furnished the music..."

Recast using: simple sentences, semicolons, periodic sentences, three-clause
sentences.

### Rule 15: Parallel Construction

Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.

| Non-parallel                                                                     | Parallel                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Formerly science was taught by textbook, while now laboratory method is employed | Formerly by textbook; now by laboratory |
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious                                     | The ceremony was both long and tedious  |
| A time not for words, but action                                                 | A time not for words, but for action    |

### Rule 16: Keep Related Words Together

Position shows relationship. Subject and verb should not be needlessly
separated.

| Separated                                                                  | Together                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description | In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description |
| He only found two mistakes                                                 | He found only two mistakes                                                |

### Rule 17: Consistent Tense

In summaries, keep to one tense. Shifting tenses suggests uncertainty.

### Rule 18: Emphatic Position

Place emphatic words at sentence end (and sometimes beginning).

| Weak ending                                                 | Strong ending                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Humanity has advanced in many ways, though not in fortitude | Humanity has advanced in many ways, but hardly in fortitude |
| This steel is used for razors, because of its hardness      | Because of its hardness, this steel is used for razors      |
