# Technical Blog Writing

Write technical posts that developers actually read by following proven patterns and classic style principles.

## Core Principles

### The Story Spine

Structure posts using narrative arc:

1. **Setup** — Establish context and the status quo
2. **Problem** — Introduce the friction or challenge
3. **Struggle** — Show what was tried, what didn't work
4. **Solution** — Present the approach that worked
5. **Improved State** — Demonstrate the outcome

This "man in hole" pattern activates reader engagement and retention.

### First Three Sentences

Answer two questions immediately:
- "Is this article for me?"
- "What will I gain from reading this?"

Avoid meandering introductions. Developers have short attention spans.

### The Skim Test

Headers alone should tell the complete story.

**Weak:** "Background", "Technical Details", "Implementation"
**Strong:** "Why Copy-Pasting Wasn't Cutting It", "40% Fewer Tokens with TOON"

## Elements of Style

For detailed examples, see [references/elements-of-style.md](references/elements-of-style.md).

### Active Voice (Rule 10)

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "The API was reverse engineered" | "I reverse engineered the API" |
| "A survey was made" | "We surveyed" |
| "There were leaves lying on the ground" | "Leaves covered the ground" |

### Positive Form (Rule 11)

Make definite assertions. Avoid non-committal language.

| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| "He was not very often on time" | "He usually came late" |
| "did not remember" | "forgot" |
| "did not pay attention to" | "ignored" |
| "not important" | "trifling" |

### Specific and Concrete (Rule 12)

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "A period of unfavorable weather" | "It rained every day for a week" |
| "significantly faster" | "40% faster" |
| "a few hours" | "4 to 5 hours" |
| "many test cases" | "630+ test cases" |

### Omit Needless Words (Rule 13)

Vigorous writing is concise. Make every word tell.

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| "the question as to whether" | "whether" |
| "owing to the fact that" | "because" |
| "he is a man who" | "he" |
| "this is a subject which" | "this subject" |
| "the fact that" | omit entirely |

### Emphatic Position (Rule 18)

Place important words at sentence end.

**Weak:** "TOON makes a difference, surprisingly."
**Strong:** "That's the difference between asking a follow-up question or hitting your context limit."

### Parallel Construction (Rule 15)

Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.

**Non-parallel:** "Formerly by textbook method, while now laboratory method is employed"
**Parallel:** "Formerly by textbook; now by laboratory"

### One Paragraph Per Topic (Rule 8)

Each paragraph signals a new step. Begin with topic sentence; end in conformity with beginning.

### Vary Sentence Structure (Rule 14)

Avoid succession of loose sentences joined by "and", "but", "so", "which". Mix simple sentences, semicolons, and periodic sentences.

## Punctuation Rules

### Oxford Comma (Rule 2)
"red, white, and blue" — comma after each term except last.

### No Comma Splice (Rule 5)
Use semicolon for independent clauses without conjunction:
"The romances are entertaining; they are full of adventures."

### Dangling Modifiers (Rule 7)
Opening phrase must refer to grammatical subject.

**Wrong:** "Being dilapidated, I bought the house cheap."
**Right:** "Being dilapidated, the house was available cheap."

## Words to Avoid

- **factor, feature** — usually adds nothing; be specific
- **interesting** — make it interesting; don't announce it
- **very** — use sparingly; prefer strong words
- **literally** — don't use for exaggeration
- **one of the most** — threadbare opener

## Structure Patterns

### The "How I Built X" Pattern

1. **Hook** — What you built and why it matters
2. **Context** — Brief background for unfamiliar readers
3. **The Problem** — What pain point drove this work
4. **The Journey** — What you tried, prior art you found
5. **The Solution** — How the tool/approach works
6. **Concrete Examples** — Real usage with actual output
7. **Under the Hood** — Technical details for curious readers
8. **Get Started** — Single, clear call to action

### The "Technique/Pattern" Pattern

1. **Hook** — The technique and its benefit
2. **The Problem** — Traditional approach and its issues
3. **The Better Approach** — Step-by-step methodology
4. **Real-World Results** — Metrics and outcomes
5. **Why This Works** — Insight behind the technique
6. **When to Use** — Applicability and limitations
7. **Conclusion** — Summary with actionable takeaway

## Engagement Techniques

### Show Concrete Value

Include at least one of:
- A practical technique readers can apply
- Clear explanation of impactful concepts
- Real terminal output or code examples

### Add Visual Breaks

- Code blocks with real output
- Tables comparing approaches
- Bullet points for lists
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)

### Include Real Examples

Don't describe—show:

```
$ command --format json | wc -c
  15234

$ command --format optimized | wc -c
  9140
```

Same data. 40% smaller.
