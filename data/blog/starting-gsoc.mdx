This year I was selected for the Google Summer of Code Program with my first
proposal. I sought a project related to Angular, especially Angular 2, to deepen
my knowledge of this framework and its new version. I was thrilled to find
[this idea](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/16) from the OpenSuse
community.

The community bonding period began April 22. I contacted my mentors and started
fixing bugs in
[Jangouts](https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07_)
while reporting issues to
[Janus-Gateway](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Aissue+author%3Amagarcia+created%3A%3C2016-05-07).
These posts will serve as a progress journal for me and my mentors.

These weeks I explored the Jangouts codebase, experimented with Angular 2, and
followed [ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org).
