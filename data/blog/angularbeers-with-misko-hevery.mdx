Last Tuesday I attended a talk by [Miško Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/about/)
about Angular 2, organized by
[AngularBeers](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Beers/). The key takeaway:
Angular is evolving from a frontend framework into a full platform.

Two upcoming features will make Angular 2 particularly powerful.

## Offline compile

Templates have been error-prone since Angular 1. Even with TypeScript or lint
tools, template errors remain undetected until runtime. Angular 1.X compiles
templates each time they render.

Angular 2 (without offline compile) compiles templates only once. With offline
compiling, templates compile to JavaScript at build time, eliminating browser
compilation. The benefits: static type-checking of templates with TypeScript, no
runtime compilation, and smaller library size.

## Angular Universal

> Universal (isomorphic) JavaScript support for Angular 2.

Angular Universal enables server-side Angular 2, providing several advantages:

1. **Better Perceived Performance:** Users instantly see a server-rendered view,
   improving perceived performance and user experience.
2. **Optimized for Search Engines:** Server-side pre-rendering ensures all
   search engines can access your content.
3. **Site Preview:** Facebook, Twitter, and other social media apps correctly
   display preview images. (I have struggled with this problem before---it is
   _frustrating_.)
