  When building a digital project, ensuring your emails land safely and are
  trusted is paramount. But how do you navigate the maze of email security?
  Enter DMARC. Alongside its companions, SPF and DKIM, we delve deep into

In the early days of developing [Voices.ink](https://voices.ink/), a
collaborative project with [@Ester Martí](https://github.com/estermv) that
effortlessly transcribes voice notes into your Notion account, I faced a common
doubt. How could I ensure that our transactional emails wouldn’t end up lost in
the void of spam folders or worse, be weaponized for phishing? My research for a
secure and trustworthy email environment led me to DMARC.

In an age where email forms the backbone of professional communication, its
security vulnerabilities are startling. Cyber attackers and fraudulent entities
are constantly on the prowl, using sophisticated techniques to deceive through
email spoofing and phishing. As email fraud escalates, the need for a robust
solution becomes imperative. Enter DMARC — an advanced email protocol that
promises to restore trust in our inboxes.

### **Why Do We Need DMARC?**

Email's inherent vulnerabilities make it susceptible to domain impersonation,
where attackers send emails pretending to be from trusted sources. While
solutions like SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified
Mail) were introduced to counter these threats, they weren’t foolproof. DMARC
(Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) fills this gap by
building upon and leveraging the strengths of both SPF and DKIM.

### **Understanding DMARC's Significance**

DMARC serves three main purposes:

1. **Authentication**: Ensuring that an email claiming to be from a specific
   domain genuinely originates from that domain.
2. **Reporting**: Enabling domain recipients to report back to the sender about
   DMARC evaluation results, thereby offering insights into potential issues.
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Granting domain owners the power to specify how
   unauthenticated emails should be handled.

### **The Building Blocks of DMARC: SPF & DKIM**

**SPF** verifies that the email's sending server has the domain owner's
authorization. It uses a specific TXT record in the DNS, like:

`v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.123 a:mail.example.com -all`

This record essentially says, "Only the IP range 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 and
198.51.100.123 are authorized to send emails for my domain."

**Explanation**:

- `v=spf1`: This indicates the version of SPF being used, which is SPF
  version 1.
- `ip4:192.0.2.0/24`: Authorizes the IP range 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 to send
  emails for the domain.
- `ip4:198.51.100.123`: Authorizes the specific IP address 198.51.100.123.
- `a:mail.example.com`: Authorizes the IP address resolved from the domain name
  mail.example.com.
- `-all`: Specifies that no other hosts are allowed to send emails. (The '-' is
  a hard fail, meaning emails from other sources should be rejected. `~all`
  would be a soft fail, suggesting they should be accepted but marked.)

**DKIM**, on the other hand, ensures the email's integrity by using
cryptographic signatures. A typical DKIM TXT DNS record might look like:

`v=DKIM1; p=MIGfMA0GCSqG...`

This record holds the public key used by receiving servers to decrypt the
email's DKIM signature and verify its authenticity.

The record's name typically includes a selector prefix, allowing the domain to
have multiple DKIM keys. When sending an email, the server will mention which
selector it's using, guiding the receiving server to the right DNS record.

**Explanation**:

- `v=DKIM1`: This signifies the version of DKIM being used.
- `p=`: This is the public key that receiving servers use to decrypt the DKIM
  signature in the email header. The actual key would be a long string
  (truncated in the example).

### **DMARC in Action**

When DMARC is implemented, domain owners publish a DMARC policy in their TXT DNS
records (using the name `_dmarc`), such as:

`v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:forensic@example.com; pct=100; aspf=r; adkim=r`

This record translates to: "If an email fails DMARC authentication, reject it.
And send aggregate DMARC reports to
[reports@example.com](mailto:reports@example.com)."

**Explanation**:

- `v=DMARC1`: Indicates the DMARC version.
- `p=reject`: Policy to apply to emails that fail DMARC. Other values can be
  `none` or `quarantine`.
- `rua=mailto:reports@example.com`: Address where aggregate DMARC reports should
  be sent.
- `ruf=mailto:forensic@example.com`: Address where forensic (detailed) DMARC
  reports should be sent.
- `pct=100`: Percentage of emails to which the DMARC policy should be applied.
- `aspf=r`: SPF alignment mode. 'r' means relaxed (default), while 's' stands
  for strict.
- `adkim=r`: DKIM alignment mode. 'r' is for relaxed, and 's' is for strict.

Once an email is received, the receiving server validates it against SPF and
DKIM. For DMARC to pass, at least one of these, SPF or DKIM, must be valid and
aligned with the claimed domain. Emails failing this check are dealt with
according to the DMARC policy — they might be rejected, quarantined, or let
through with no action.

### **The Takeaway**

With the rise in sophisticated phishing attacks and the paramount importance of
trust in digital communication, DMARC is more than just an advanced email
security protocol. It's a beacon of trust, ensuring that genuine emails see the
light of day while malicious ones lurk in the shadows. For organizations and
individuals alike, understanding and implementing DMARC is a step towards a
safer, more trustworthy digital communication landscape.

So, the next time you're looking at your email security measures, remember that
DMARC isn't just an option — it's a necessity.
