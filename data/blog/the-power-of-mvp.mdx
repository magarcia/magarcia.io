  A minimum viable product (MVP) is often linked to the startup world but is a
  very useful tool in large corporations too. And to succeed with it is
  important to have engineering teams be completely engaged.

Much has been written about minimum viable products (MVP). I doubt I can add new
insights, but I can share my perspective from an experience with one client.

Let me set the scene. The client was a leading European real estate
company—though the domain matters little here. The product team envisioned a
complex product to sell to their customers. To gauge user acceptance, we ran
multiple A/B tests to find the most successful approach. The product was
straightforward to implement, but deciding which users should see what was
another story. We had to account for user location, search location, last visit,
and more. The number of variables was large, so we ran the tests for nearly half
a year to gather meaningful data.

This kind of experiment requires proper metrics, so we measured everything. Once
the test finished, the data analysis team did their job—and the results
disappointed us. They fell far short of expectations. Yet one small part of the
product resonated strongly with users, and a month later the product team built
a new product around it.

Now the real story begins. The new product lacked the complex rules of the
previous one: no location logic, no visit history, no search patterns. Customers
would get a special section on the page to showcase their products and share it
as they liked. Since the user-facing part already existed from the previous
test, it was time to make it real and start selling.

We held a meeting to define the architecture and implementation plan. Two
engineering teams, the head of technology, and the product owner—about 14 people
in virtual rooms across countries—discussed the best approach and estimated
completion. Someone pointed out that since customers had to purchase the
product, we'd need to involve the commerce team. The products team would create
a new microservice, and the website team would consume and process that data to
enable the product for each customer.

Complexity piled up again. Initial estimates put delivery at three months
minimum—probably more, given coordination across engineering, marketing, and
design. Listening to these discussions, I asked the product owner: "_How will
you sell this product in the short term?_" The answer unlocked an easier path.
Initially, a small sales team would contact only the most important customers.
After that, they'd evaluate which other customers might be interested.

With this information, I proposed an unorthodox approach. Instead of building
the complex system, coordinating multiple teams, and blocking the launch until
everything was done—why not hardcode customer IDs? A few lines of logic, and
we're done. Each time the product sold, someone would email the team, and we'd
add the ID in minutes. This solution doesn't scale, but it wasn't meant to.
Since sales would be handled manually at first, we could control the pace of
customer acquisition.

Everyone received the proposal well. We could start selling earlier and relieve
pressure on the engineering teams. Within one week we had the product in place
and sold to the first customer. Over the following months, the teams worked at a
relaxed pace on the final implementation—one that would eliminate manual steps.

That's the story. Here's what I learned:

- Keep the implementation as simple as possible. You'll reach the market earlier
  and may relax some deadlines along the way.
- Involve engineering teams early in product definition. Different perspectives
  surface better solutions.
- Share the full project vision with engineers, not just their piece. Context
  shapes better architecture.

In conclusion: I'll keep practicing what I consider one of the most important
traits in a developer—laziness. That instinct drives me to find the simplest,
fastest way to solve a problem.
