GSoC midterm just passed. Time to review the work since the project started.
After these weeks working on Jangouts and using it regularly for follow-up
meetings, I love it as if it were my own. Working on this project is rewarding:
small enough to grasp, yet backed by a growing community. Jangouts remains in an
early stage but has great potential.

## Work done

I missed my initial timeline, but I am close and the hardest part is over.
Jangouts now uses TypeScript with a new build/development process and runs as a
hybrid Angular 1.x/Angular 2 application.

Jangouts is composed of different components:

- `browser-info`
- `chat` - **Migrated**
- `feed` - **Almost migrated**
- `footer` - **Migrated**
- `notifier`
- `room`
- `router`
- `screen-share`
- `user`
- `videochat`
- `signin`

Each component migration involves conversion from Angular 1 to 2 and tests
targeting near 100% coverage. The most complex components to migrate are `feed`
and `room` because they handle video rendering and Janus backend communication.
The router will likely require a complete rewrite for the new Angular 2 router.

## Mentors

I have only good things to say about @ancorgs and @imobach. We hold daily
meetings (when possible), and they give me feedback while allowing me freedom to
make my own decisions (when I provide reasons).

## Next steps

In the coming weeks, I will continue migrating components until Angular 1 can be
removed. When migration finishes, Jangouts will be an Angular 2 project with a
comprehensive test suite. My GSoC work will be complete, but I want to do more.
Many things can improve:

1. Restructure the project by moving logic from components to services.
2. Leverage Observables better (probably using
   [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store))
3. Improve UI and mobile UX using
   [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)
   concepts.
4. Improve communication and community (project webpage, better contribution
   docs, etc.)
