A few weeks have passed since my last post. I have been busy.

Tomorrow the GSoC coding period begins. As mentioned previously, I have been
working on Jangouts: making contributions, fixing bugs, and more. Last week I
started writing tests for some components. A complete test suite would be wasted
effort since the code will change significantly during the Angular 2 migration.
These tests help me understand how Jangouts is structured and how it works.

During the community bonding period, I stayed in contact with my mentors
([@imobach](https://github.com/imobach) and
[@ancorgs](https://github.com/ancorgs)). This past week we had a Jangouts call
(we use Jangouts for meetings) to plan the coming weeks. We will use a Trello
board to organize tasks and hold daily meetings to track progress. I also
committed to writing a weekly blog post summarizing my work.

The Angular 2 migration starts in the coming days, but first I need a plan.
