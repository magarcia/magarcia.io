title: YumML - Yet Another Recipe Metadata Format
date: "2026-01-10"
spoiler:
  Existing recipe formats are old, poorly specified, or have license
  restrictions. YumML makes cooking recipes human and machine readable.

Years ago, talking with a friend, we realized that no standard format exists for
saving cooking recipes. At that time I was learning React, and one of my early
projects was a recipe management app. I didn't succeed (like many projects I
started and never finished), but along the way I found a draft spec for a recipe
format: **YumML**.

_Yes, I'm fully aware of the irony. [xkcd.com/927](https://xkcd.com/927)_

<br />

Paul Jenkins published this format on [vikingco.de](http://vikingco.de/), but
the site is now offline. The only references available are from the
[Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730232450/http://vikingco.de/)
and the
[repository of the page](https://github.com/vikingcode/vikingcode.github.io)
that remains available.

> The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
> “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
> interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## History

The first draft of the YumML format is from September 21, 2011, made by Paul
Jenkins, you can check the
[original specification here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730232450/http://vikingco.de/yumml.html)
that I rescued from the old archives I found.

This draft is promising as a format for cooking recipes, so I want to recover it
from the forgotten archives and revive it, adding extra functionalities and
specifications.

## Motivation

As the original author of YumML mentioned in his blog post, I've investigated
cooking recipe formats and, to be clear, most suck. The landscape of recipe
interchange formats is fragmented, but most share one trait: they lack human
readability.

Most cooking software ships with proprietary formats that only that software can
read. Some can be imported by other programs.
[Meal-Master](http://web.archive.org/web/20151029032924/http://episoft.home.comcast.net:80/~episoft/)
is one of these widely supported formats and due to that there is a
[huge collection of recipes](http://www.ffts.com/recipes.htm) available online.

But looking at an example, the format seems poorly specified:

```txt
MMMMM----- Now You're Cooking! v5.65 [Meal-Master Export Format]

      Title: Agua De Valencia
 Categories: beverages, spanish
      Yield: 4 servings

      1    bottle of spanish cava
           -(sparkling wine or; champag
           plenty fresh orange juice
           cointreau
           ice cubes

Put some ice cubes into a large jug and pour over lots of orange juice. Now
add the bottle of cava. Once the fizz subsides, stir in a good dash of the
cointreau and it's ready to serve.

```

There are some other "famous" formats like:

- [RecipeML](http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html)
- [Recipe Exchange Markup Language](http://reml.sourceforge.net/)
- [CookML](http://www.kalorio.de/index.php?Mod=Ac&Cap=CE&SCa=../cml/CookML_EN)

But they are mainly XML-based formats, and no human can read a recipe written in
them. If you're interested in finding other recipe formats, there is a
[list of software-related cooking formats](http://microformats.org/wiki/recipe-formats).

It's worth mentioning some formats that came with the age of the Internet. HTML
microdata like
[Google rich snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe)
and [schema.org microdata](http://schema.org/Recipe) are widely used by
commercial recipe sites. Although microdata's main objective is
machine-readability (especially for SEO), people still read and follow recipes.

Finally, I found [pesto](https://6xq.net/pesto/), which aims for a simpler
human-readable format, but I find it difficult to understand for someone who is
unfamiliar with the syntax.

## Original design considerations

The original author of YumML had some considerations in mind during the design
of the format:

- Does not need a long reference guide.
- Can be easily read by non-technical people in the "raw" format.
- Can be translatable between imperial and metric.
- Want something like the _markdown_ of recipes (but still easy to parse with
  software).

YumML is based on YAML to create a human _and_ system readable format.

**From [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)**

> What It Is: YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all
> programming languages.

## Why YAML in the Age of AI

When the original YumML spec was drafted in 2011, the consideration was purely
about human and machine readability. Today, there's a third reader to consider:
**Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

As AI assistants become common in kitchens (think voice assistants reading
recipes aloud, or chatbots helping you adapt recipes), the format you choose for
structured data matters more than ever. Recent research shows that data format
significantly impacts both **token efficiency** (cost) and **model accuracy**
when LLMs process structured information.

[Benchmarks across different models](https://www.improvingagents.com/blog/best-nested-data-format/)
show that YAML uses **27-40% fewer tokens than JSON** and **38-40% fewer than
XML** for the same data. Beyond cost savings, format also affects comprehension:
YAML achieved **12-18 percentage points higher accuracy** than JSON when models
extracted information from nested data. The cleaner syntax with less punctuation
noise helps models parse semantic content more reliably. While
[minified JSON can be more efficient](https://www.curiouslychase.com/posts/yaml-vs-json-for-llm-token-efficiency-the-minification-truth),
it sacrifices human readability entirely, which defeats YumML's core goals.

### The best of both worlds

YAML's design strikes a balance that works well for this three-way readability
requirement:

- **Humans** can read it without training (no angle brackets or curly braces)
- **Machines** can parse it with standard libraries in any language
- **AI models** process it more efficiently and accurately than alternatives

This makes YumML particularly well-suited for modern recipe applications where
an AI might help you scale a recipe, suggest substitutions, or convert between
metric and imperial, all while keeping the source format readable in a text
editor.

## Goals

I want to define more formal goals for the spec.

YumML format:

- **MUST** be human **and** system readable.
- **MUST** be self contained, so it **MUST NOT** require additional resources to
  be interpreted.
- **MUST** have support for different metric systems _(metric, imperial)_.
- **SHOULD** be easy to translate into different languages _(recipes have a
  strong cultural influence and language should not be a barrier to someone who
  wants to understand)_.
- **SHOULD** be easy to parse using already existing tools.
- **SHOULD** be easy to extend in the future.

## Technical Details

- **File extension**: `.yumml` (files **MUST** be valid YAML)
- **MIME type**: `application/x-yumml+yaml`
- **Encoding**: UTF-8

## Basic Example

```yumml
name: Mrs Fields Choc-Chip Cookies
date: 2011-09-21
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 10 minutes
ingredients:
  - quantity: 2.5
    unit: cups
    item: plain flour

  - quantity: 0.5
    unit: tsp
    item: bicarbonate of soda

instructions:
  - step: Mix flour, bicarbonate of soda, and salt in a large bowl
  - step: Blend sugars with electric mixer, add margarine to form a grainy paste
```

## Spec

There are three main sections that every recipe **MUST** include: the header,
the ingredients list, and the instructions.

### Header

The header is an implicit section where all the attributes are placed at the
root level of the file. All the attributes **SHOULD** be placed at the top of
the file, before `ingredients` and `instructions`.

| Attribute     | Type         | Status       | Description                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string       | **REQUIRED** | Name of the recipe                                                                                        |
| `date`        | string       | OPTIONAL     | Publication date ([RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) format, e.g., `2017-07-21`) |
| `author`      | string       | OPTIONAL     | Author of the recipe                                                                                      |
| `description` | string       | OPTIONAL     | Brief description of the recipe                                                                           |
| `prepTime`    | duration     | OPTIONAL     | Preparation time (e.g., `15 minutes`)                                                                     |
| `cookTime`    | duration     | OPTIONAL     | Cooking/baking time (e.g., `10 minutes`)                                                                  |
| `totalTime`   | duration     | OPTIONAL     | Total time (**MAY** be derived from `prepTime` + `cookTime`)                                              |
| `servings`    | integer      | OPTIONAL     | Number of portions the recipe serves                                                                      |
| `yield`       | string       | OPTIONAL     | What the recipe produces (e.g., `24 cookies`, `1 loaf`)                                                   |
| `rating`      | number (1-5) | OPTIONAL     | Recipe rating                                                                                             |
| `tags`        | string[]     | OPTIONAL     | Categorization tags                                                                                       |

**Duration format**: Human-readable strings. For maximum compatibility, use
integers followed by `minutes`, `hours`, or `seconds` (e.g., `15 minutes`,
`1 hour 30 minutes`). Parsers **SHOULD** also accept common abbreviations
(`15 min`, `1 hr`) and natural variations (`1.5 hours`).

#### Example

```yumml:1-10
name: Mrs Fields Choc-Chip Cookies
date: 2011-09-21
author: Paul Jenkins
description: Classic chocolate chip cookies, crispy outside and chewy inside.
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 10 minutes
servings: 4
yield: 24 cookies
tags:
  - cookies
  - chocolate
ingredients:
  - quantity: 2.5
    unit: cups
    item: plain flour

  - quantity: 0.5
    unit: tsp
    item: bicarbonate of soda

instructions:
  - step: Mix flour, bicarbonate of soda, and salt in a large bowl
  - step: Blend sugars with electric mixer, add margarine to form a grainy paste
```

### Ingredients

The `ingredients` section is a **REQUIRED** list of all ingredients needed for
the recipe.

| Attribute  | Type             | Status       | Description                                                             |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quantity` | number \| string | OPTIONAL     | Amount (number, fraction like `"1/2"`, or descriptor like `"to taste"`) |
| `unit`     | string           | OPTIONAL     | Unit of measurement (see canonical units below)                         |
| `item`     | string           | **REQUIRED** | Name of the ingredient                                                  |
| `notes`    | string           | OPTIONAL     | Additional notes (e.g., `room temperature`, `finely chopped`)           |
| `optional` | boolean          | OPTIONAL     | Whether the ingredient is optional (default: `false`)                   |

#### Canonical Units

To support conversion between metric and imperial systems, implementations
**SHOULD** recognize these canonical unit abbreviations:

| Category | Units                                         |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Volume   | `tsp`, `tbsp`, `cup`, `ml`, `l`, `fl-oz`      |
| Weight   | `g`, `kg`, `oz`, `lb`                         |
| Count    | _(omit `unit` for countable items like eggs)_ |

#### Example

```yumml
ingredients:
  # Numeric quantities
  - quantity: 2.5
    unit: cups
    item: plain flour

  - quantity: 200
    unit: g
    item: chocolate chips
    notes: semi-sweet

  # Fraction string (more readable than 0.5)
  - quantity: "1/2"
    unit: cup
    item: walnuts
    notes: chopped
    optional: true

  # Countable items (no unit needed)
  - quantity: 2
    item: eggs
    notes: room temperature

  # Descriptor string for fuzzy amounts
  - quantity: "to taste"
    item: salt

  # No quantity (implied "some")
  - item: cooking spray
    notes: for greasing
```

### Instructions

The `instructions` section is a **REQUIRED** list of steps to prepare the
recipe. Instructions support two formats: a simple flat list or grouped sections
for complex recipes.

#### Simple Format

| Attribute     | Type     | Status       | Description                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `step`        | string   | **REQUIRED** | The instruction text                       |
| `duration`    | duration | OPTIONAL     | Time for this step                         |
| `temperature` | string   | OPTIONAL     | Temperature setting (e.g., `180C`, `350F`) |

```yumml
instructions:
  - step: Preheat oven
    temperature: 180C
  - step: Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl
  - step: Bake until golden brown
    duration: 10 minutes
```

#### Grouped Format

For complex recipes with multiple stages, instructions **MAY** be organized into
sections:

> **Implementation note**: Parsers **MUST** handle both formats. Check for the
> presence of `section` to determine the format: if any item has a `section`
> field, treat as grouped; otherwise, treat as simple.

```yumml
instructions:
  - section: For the dough
    steps:
      - step: Mix flour and salt
      - step: Add water gradually

  - section: For the filling
    steps:
      - step: Sauté onions until translucent
        duration: 5 minutes
      - step: Add remaining filling ingredients
```

## Design Notes

A few decisions deserve explanation.

### Why `quantity` is optional and accepts strings

Cooking is fuzzy. Real recipes include instructions like "salt to taste", "a
pinch of nutmeg", or "butter for greasing". Forcing a numeric quantity would
either exclude these cases or push authors toward awkward workarounds like
`quantity: 0`.

Allowing strings also enables fractions like `"1/2"`, which are more readable in
a recipe context than `0.5`. The trade-off is that parsers need to handle
multiple types, but this reflects the inherent ambiguity of cooking rather than
fighting it.

### Why human-readable durations instead of ISO 8601

ISO 8601 durations (`PT25M`) are unambiguous and machine-friendly, but they fail
the "readable by a non-technical person" goal. A home cook glancing at a
`.yumml` file should immediately understand `25 minutes` without consulting a
reference.

The spec recommends a structured subset (`integer + unit`) for tools that need
reliable parsing but remains flexible enough to accept natural variations.

### Why instructions support two formats

Simple recipes don't need sections. Forcing authors to write `section: main` for
a basic cookie recipe adds friction. But complex recipes (like a multi-component
pie) genuinely benefit from grouping steps by stage.

The polymorphic design prioritizes author convenience over parser simplicity.
The implementation note makes the parsing logic explicit: check for `section` to
determine the format.

## What's Next

This spec is a starting point—to become useful, YumML needs implementations. If
you're interested in contributing:

- **Write a parser** in your favorite language (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust...)
- **Build a converter** from [schema.org/Recipe](http://schema.org/Recipe) to
  YumML
- **Create a VS Code extension** with syntax highlighting and validation
- **Experiment with LLMs** to see how well they can generate and parse YumML

If you build something, I'd love to hear about it.
