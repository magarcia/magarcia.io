If you write JavaScript regularly, you've likely needed to check whether a
variable is `undefined`.

But, what is the best way to do it?

## The intuitive way

Any programmer experienced in other languages will intuit:

```js
if (x === undefined) { ... }
```

This works without problems--almost.

Direct comparison with `undefined` works in all modern browsers. Old browsers,
however, allowed reassignment:

```js
undefined = "new value";
```

With this reassignment, direct comparison fails.

[ECMAScript 5](https://es5.github.io/#x15.1.1.3) fixed this in 2009:

> **15.1.1.3 undefined**  
> The value of `undefined` is **undefined** (see 8.1). This property has the
> attributes
> `{ [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: false }`.

## The “safe” way

If you support old browsers and worry about `undefined` reassignment, use
alternative methods.

### Reading the type

The
[typeof operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)
returns `"undefined"` for undefined values:

```js
if (typeof x === "undefined") { ... }
```

**Note:** `typeof` does not throw an error for undeclared variables.

### Using `void`

The
[void operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void)
also returns undefined:

```js
if (x === void(0)) { ... }
```

The zero has no special meaning. As MDN states:

> The **void operator** evaluates the given _expression_ and then returns
> [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined).

## Which way is better

As a consultant, I learned the best answer: it depends. Here are some tips.

Follow existing codebase conventions. For new code running only on modern
browsers, use direct comparison--it's clear and readable even for JavaScript
beginners. For old browser support, create an `isUndefined` function with your
preferred method inside. This expresses intent clearly.
